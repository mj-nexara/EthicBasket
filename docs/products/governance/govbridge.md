# 🌉 GovBridge — Federated Governance Interlink Module

**GovBridge** is a sovereign-grade governance integrator designed to connect decentralized systems, share ledger insights, and synchronize policy triggers across federated ecosystems.

It forms a secure bridge between NexAscend's governance stack and external nodes, enabling verified inter-protocol communication, joint referendums, and compliance mirroring.

---

## 🔗 Core Functions

- 📡 Bi-directional policy sync (OGA/TDL/VPT aligned)
- 🔐 Token-sealed ledger sharing (via LumID Vault)
- 🗳️ Cross-node referendum propagation
- 🧬 Role schema normalization across platforms
- 📁 Invocation relay for joint governance actions

---

## 🧪 Invocation Example

```
python nexascend-controller.py --invoke payloads/govbridge-session.json
```

⚙️ This triggers a governance sync operation with an external node, verifying motion compatibility and initiating ledger handshake.

---

## 🧬 Sample Payload (`govbridge-session.json`)

```
{
  "actor": "validator",
  "external_node": "nexgov.alpha.org",
  "action": "propagate-motion",
  "motion_id": "OGA-AMEND-003",
  "lumid_token": "VAL-TKN-6340",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-26T06:22:00Z"
}
```

## 🛡️ Verification Metrics

| Metric                   | Status   |
|--------------------------|----------|
| Token validity           | ✅ Verified |
| External node registry   | ✅ Matched |
| Motion schema integrity  | ✅ Checked |
| Quorum relay             | ✅ Confirmed |
| Ledger sync trigger      | ✅ Initiated |

---

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Notes

- Supports CLI flags `--node`, `--motion`, `--relay`
- Ledger sync compatible with NexaraGov and LumID Vault
- External nodes must be registry-approved with schema parity

---

## 📜 Ethical Compliance

GovBridge operates under the **Federated Motion Protocol (FMP)** ensuring:

- Shared ledger transparency
- Role verification across systems
- Immutable sync logs
- Joint quorum accountability

---

> Sovereign frameworks shouldn’t be silos. GovBridge lets decentralized minds co-govern with clarity, accountability, and traceable unity.
