# 🏛️ Constitution Kit — Ethical Governance Bootstrap

The **Constitution Kit** is a governance framework starter pack designed for decentralized ecosystems seeking clarity, accountability, and ethical alignment.

It provides modular templates, role schemas, ratification flows, and policy auditing tools — all traceable via NexAscend’s invocation logic.

## 📦 Included Modules

- 📜 Foundational Charter template
- 🧩 Role Schema mapper (`LumID`)
- 🔐 Ratification workflow with audit triggers
- 🔍 Policy Compliance checker
- 🗳️ Referendum & Voting logic templates
- 📁 Traceable Constitution Ledger (JSON)

## 🧪 Bootstrap Invocation

```
python nexascend-controller.py --invoke payloads/init-constitution.json
