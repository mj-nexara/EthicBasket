# 🔄 EthicSync — Distributed Ethics Synchronization Engine

**EthicSync** is a decentralized module engineered to harmonize ethical disclosures, policy checkpoints, and trust signatures across NexAscend-powered ecosystems.

It serves as the backbone for synchronized governance audits, DIEF/VPT/OGA alignment tracking, and federated compliance verification — without central oversight.

---

## 🧩 Key Functions

- 📜 Sync ethical disclosures across node clusters
- 🧮 Compare policy versions for amendment validity
- 📂 Relay trust payloads (signed DIEF/OGA/VPT schemas)
- 🔍 Trigger federated audit sessions for governance snapshots
- 📡 Broadcast consensus state across EthicBasket nodes

---

## 🧪 Invocation Example

```
python nexascend-controller.py --invoke payloads/ethicsync-session.json
```

🔐 Initiates cross-node ethics sync, validates schema parity, and commits trust signals to ledger registries.

## 🔎 Verification Metrics

| Metric                   | Status   |
|--------------------------|----------|
| Token verification       | ✅ Passed |
| Schema version parity    | ✅ Confirmed |
| Disclosure traceability  | ✅ Verified |
| Node registry match      | ✅ Synced |
| Snapshot log             | ✅ Stored |

---

## ⚖️ Protocol Alignment

EthicSync operates within NexAscend’s ethical framework:

- **DIEF** — validates identity mapping across disclosures
- **OGA** — confirms charter and amendment propagation
- **VPT** — traces participation and quorum metadata

All sync events are ledger-audited and schema-bound.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Notes

- CLI flags: `--sync-type`, `--target-nodes`, `--schema`
- Compatible with GovBridge and Nexara SDK audit stubs
- Sync snapshots stored under `/ethicsync/snapshots/`

---

> Ethics shouldn’t be optional or opaque. EthicSync makes trust a traceable utility — shared, validated, and sovereign by design.
