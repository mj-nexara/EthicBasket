Here’s your modular and governance-aligned `nexara-sdk.md` page, MJ — designed to reflect the precision tooling and ethical scaffolding NexAscend embodies. This SDK empowers developers to build, audit, and extend sovereign-grade workflows with clarity and control.
# 🧠 Nexara SDK — Ethical Governance Extensibility Kit

The **Nexara SDK** is a role-aware software development kit crafted for building traceable, schema-compliant governance workflows across decentralized infrastructures.

Packed with predefined hooks, payload validators, and ledger connectors, it enables seamless interaction with NexAscend's CLI tools, voting engines, and ratification frameworks.

---

## 🧰 What's Inside

- 🧩 Payload schema validator (`invoke-schema-v2`)
- 🔗 CLI hook interfaces for NexAscend tools
- 📜 Charter and referendum parser templates
- 📊 Governance ledger bridge (read/write modules)
- 🛡️ Compliance audit stub library (OGA/DIEF/VPT)
- 🧑‍💻 API templates for external role mapping services

---

## 🔗 Invocation Flow Integration

```
python nexascend-controller.py --invoke payloads/sdk-hook-call.json
```

📎 Enables SDK-powered hooks and role-bound service invocations within broader governance automation scripts.

## ⚖️ Ethical Foundations

The SDK complies with NexAscend’s ethical stack:

| Protocol      | Focus                             | Status   |
|---------------|------------------------------------|----------|
| OGA           | Charter integrity and amendments   | ✅ Linked |
| DIEF          | Identity protection and access     | ✅ Verified |
| VPT           | Voting provenance and transparency | ✅ Integrated |

---

## 🔐 Role Mapping Logic

SDK verifies every module trigger against LumID roles before executing sensitive governance actions.

| Role        | Module Access        |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Founder     | Charter & schema tools|
| Advocate    | Referendum & parser   |
| Validator   | Audit stub & ledger   |

> SDKs shouldn't just serve developers — they should uphold principles. Nexara empowers you to build governance that doesn’t just function, but stands for something.
