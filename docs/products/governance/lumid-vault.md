# 🛡️ LumID Vault — Sovereign Identity Custodian

The **LumID Vault** is the cornerstone of role authentication and invocation trust across NexAscend. It secures decentralized identity tokens (LumIDs), manages validity thresholds, and enforces ethical access logic via schema bindings.

Through traceable payload schemas and immutable role mapping, LumID Vault ensures every action in the ecosystem is backed by verified intent and identity.

---

## 🔐 Core Functions

- 🔑 Store and validate `LumID` tokens
- 🧮 Manage expiration, issuer trust, and invocation scope
- 🧩 Bind identities to role schemas in CLI payloads
- 📁 Ledger-backed identity verification for audits
- ⚙️ Dynamic revocation via governance events

---

## 🧪 Access Trigger Example

```
python nexascend-controller.py --invoke payloads/lumid-verify.json
```

🔍 Verifies a LumID token’s integrity, validity, and role mapping before any invocation is allowed.

---

## 🧬 Sample Payload Schema (`lumid-verify.json`)

```
{
  "actor": "validator",
  "lumid_token": "VAL-TKN-8610",
  "verification_scope": ["subscription", "vote-session"],
  "timestamp": "2025-07-26T05:45:00Z",
  "action": "verify-lumid"
}
```

## 📊 Verification Checklist

| Checkpoint            | Status   |
|-----------------------|----------|
| Token format          | ✅ Valid |
| Issuer registry match | ✅ Confirmed |
| Expiration threshold  | ✅ Active |
| Role mapping          | ✅ Verified |
| Scope binding         | ✅ Passed |

## ⚖️ Ethical Boundaries

The LumID Vault enforces the **Decentralized Identity Ethics Framework (DIEF)** which mandates:

- Explicit role attribution per invocation
- Audit visibility for token usage
- No biometric or off-chain correlation
- Immutable expiration and revocation logs

---

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Notes

- Vault is CLI-integrated and ledger-linked
- Supports `--check-token`, `--scope`, and `--role` flags
- Role definitions loaded from `/roles/schema-map.json`

---

> LumID Vault isn't just where identities live — it's where sovereignty is shielded. Every invocation starts with ethical validation.
