# 🧵 Symbolic Threads — Wearable Invocations of Ethic

**Symbolic Threads** are tangible artifacts — apparel, accessories, and memorabilia — designed to externalize the ethos of NexAscend and EthicBasket.

From ceremony-grade T-shirts to governance-aligned journals, each item embeds intention and identity. This isn’t merchandising; it’s material invocation.
