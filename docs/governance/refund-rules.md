# 🔍 Audit Policies — EthicBasket Sovereign Oversight

These audit policies govern transactional integrity, subscription compliance, and sovereign invocation activities across the EthicBasket ecosystem.

---

## 🧮 Invocation Ledger Audits

- All product invocations are logged in `ethicbasket-ledger`
- Periodic checksum verification via NexAscend CLI:  
  `nexascend-controller.py --verify-ledger`
- Compliance thresholds: 
  - **Digital Products** → 95% automation alignment
  - **Vital Assets** → Verified delivery receipts
  - **Governance Modules** → Rule match score ≥ 0.9

---

## 🔐 Identity & Role-Based Inspections

- Identity validation via LumID integration
- Role-scoped audit filters (e.g., supplier, verifier, consumer)
- Scheduled review of vault-backed invocation logs

| Tier      | Audit Frequency | Verifier Node       | Score Threshold |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Basic     | Monthly          | `nexara-gov-node-01`| ≥ 0.7           |

## 🚨 Triggered Audits

- Invoked if anomaly > 3% in ledger delta
- Automated alert via `ethicsync-notifier`
- Fallback protocol → `govbridge-integrator` review

> _These audit policies uphold the invocation sanctity and sovereign-grade compliance EthicBasket stands for._


# 💸 Refund Rules — Invocation-Driven Reversal Logic

EthicBasket enables controlled refund mechanisms, subject to sovereign invocation protocols and product classification tiers.

---

## 🔁 Invocation-Based Reversal Eligibility

- Refunds allowed only if invocation is reversible
- Threshold: Invocation integrity score < 0.6
- Governance clause: `refund-eligibility-verdict` must match product policy

## 🧩 Product Class Refund Matrix

| Category         | Eligibility Window | Refund Method      | Proof Required     |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Digital Products | 3 days             | Ledger Rollback     | CLI Invocation Log |
| Vital Assets     | 7 days             | Physical Reclaim    | Delivery Slip      |

## 🔓 Refund Approval Invocation

```
nexascend-controller.py --initiate-refund --txid <TRANSACTION_ID>
```

- Requires quorum signature from `ethicvote-validator`
- Verifiable on-chain trigger recorded by `ethicbasket-ledger`

---

## 🛑 Rejection Protocol

- Refunds rejected if:
  - Product flagged during audit
  - Tampering detected via `lumid-scan`
  - Invocation expiry exceeded

> _Refunds are an invocation ritual—secured, sovereign, and subject to audit integrity._
